title: Creating a blog

Hello World! I finally decided to make a blog to put my ramblings and projects.

After some deliberation I settled on using next.js, so I can use React+TypeScript, don't need a server and the website is accessible without JS enabled.

The content is written [as markdown](https://github.com/phiresky/blog/tree/master/posts), though I'm adding some neat stuff so I can do stuff like this:

````code

```barchart
title: Awesomeness of my blog
series: Awesomeness from 1 to 10
data:
    mine: 11
    hediet's: 5
```
````

to result in this:

```barchart
title: Awesomeness of my blog
series: Awesomeness from 1 to 10
data:
    mine: 11
    hediet's: 5
```
