On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5% and 17.0%, respectively, which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully connected layers we employed a recently developed regularization method called \\"dropout\\" that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%, compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry.","title":"ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks","type":"article-journal","issue":"6"},{"note":"arXiv: 1409.1556","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556","container-title":"arXiv:1409.1556 \\\\[cs\\\\]","author":[{"family":"Simonyan","given":"Karen"},{"family":"Zisserman","given":"Andrew"}],"id":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019","12","13"]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2014","9"]]},"abstract":"In this work we investigate the effect of the convolutional network depth on its accuracy in the large-scale image recognition setting.

On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5% and 17.0%, respectively, which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully connected layers we employed a recently developed regularization method called \\"dropout\\" that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%, compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry.","title":"ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks","type":"article-journal","issue":"6"},{"note":"arXiv: 1409.1556","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556","container-title":"arXiv:1409.1556 \\\\[cs\\\\]","author":[{"family":"Simonyan","given":"Karen"},{"family":"Zisserman","given":"Andrew"}],"id":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019","12","13"]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2014","9"]]},"abstract":"In this work we investigate the effect of the convolutional network depth on its accuracy in the large-scale image recognition setting. Our main contribution is a thorough evaluation of networks of increasing depth using an architecture with very small (3x3) convolution filters, which shows that a significant improvement on the prior-art configurations can be achieved by pushing the depth to 16-19 weight layers. These findings were the basis of our ImageNet Challenge 2014 submission, where our team secured the first and the second places in the localisation and classification tracks respectively. We also show that our representations generalise well to other datasets, where they achieve state-of-the-art results. We have made our two best-performing ConvNet models publicly available to facilitate further research on the use of deep visual representations in computer vision.","title":"Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition","type":"article-journal","keyword":"Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"},{"DOI":"10.1109/CVPR.2015.7298594","URL":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7298594","page":"1-9","container-title":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)","author":[{"family":"Szegedy","given":"C."},{"literal":"Wei Liu"},{"literal":"Yangqing Jia"},{"family":"Sermanet","given":"P."},{"family":"Reed","given":"S."},{"family":"Anguelov","given":"D."},{"family":"Erhan","given":"D."},{"family":"Vanhoucke","given":"V."},{"family":"Rabinovich","given":"A."}],"id":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7298594","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019","12","13"]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2015","6"]]},"abstract":"We propose a deep convolutional neural network architecture codenamed Inception that achieves the new state of the art for classification and detection in the ImageNet Large-Scale Visual Recognition Challenge 2014 (ILSVRC14). The main hallmark of this architecture is the improved utilization of the computing resources inside the network. By a carefully crafted design, we increased the depth and width of the network while keeping the computational budget constant. To optimize quality, the architectural decisions were based on the Hebbian principle and the intuition of multi-scale processing. One particular incarnation used in our submission for ILSVRC14 is called GoogLeNet, a 22 layers deep network, the quality of which is assessed in the context of classification and detection.","title":"Going deeper with convolutions","type":"paper-conference","keyword":"convolution, decision making, feature extraction, Hebbian learning, image classification, neural net architecture, resource allocation, convolutional neural network architecture, resource utilization, architectural decision, Hebbian principle, object classification, object detection, Computer architecture, Convolutional codes, Sparse matrices, Neural networks, Visualization, Object detection, Computer vision"},{"DOI":"10.1109/CVPR.2016.90","URL":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7780459","page":"770-778","container-title":"2016 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)","author":[{"family":"He","given":"K."},{"family":"Zhang","given":"X."},{"family":"Ren","given":"S."},{"family":"Sun","given":"J."}],"id":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7780459","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019","12","13"]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2016","6"]]},"abstract":"Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers - 8\xd7 deeper than VGG nets \\\\[40\\\\] but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC & COCO 2015 competitions1, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.","title":"Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition","type":"paper-conference","keyword":"image classification, learning (artificial intelligence), neural nets, object detection, COCO segmentation, ImageNet localization, ILSVRC & COCO 2015 competitions, deep residual nets, COCO object detection dataset, visual recognition tasks, CIFAR-10, ILSVRC 2015 classification task, ImageNet test set, VGG nets, residual nets, ImageNet dataset, residual function learning, deeper neural network training, image recognition, deep residual learning, Training, Degradation, Complexity theory, Image recognition, Neural networks, Visualization, Image segmentation"}],"date":"July 17, 2006","csl":"ieee-with-url.csl","hidden":true,"author":["John MacFarlane","Anonymous"],"url2cite-link-output":"sup","title":"Pandoc Test Suite"},"preview":"This is a set of tests for pandoc.
